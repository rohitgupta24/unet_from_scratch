Implementaion of U-Net architecture for Semantic Segmentation

Semantic Segmentaion : Consider an image and make a bounding box around each object, this will be Object Detection.
                       If we paint the pixel around every obejct, it is semantic segmentation where every pixel represents either an object or non-object/background, UNET is designed to do this.
                       one step further is Instance Segmentaion.
